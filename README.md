# 🌸 Iris Classification Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to the classic **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into three species: *Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica*.  
It involves data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and saving the best-performing model for future predictions.  

## 📊 Project Steps  
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.  
2. Train multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes).  
3. Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
4. Save the best model for deployment.
