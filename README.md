# 🌸 Iris Classification Project  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to the classic Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.  
It includes data preprocessing, training and evaluating multiple classification algorithms, and saving the most accurate model for reliable predictions.
